    <h3>Research Experience</h3>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>The need to improve the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Hawraman region after the global registration of the cultural landscape</strong></em>: <i>(Joint work with Dr. Nader Naderi, Moein Soleimani, and Sahar Rostami)</i>.<br>
        Hawraman is a region with a long history and ancient background, customs, traditions, and special cultural symbols, which was registered on the world record of its cultural landscape during July 16-31, 2021, at the 44th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee. Due to the limitations and backwardness of the past, by recording the cultural landscape of Hawraman, the need to create employment, increase income sources, reduce migration from this region to the city, reduce class differences, increase productivity in the tourism sector, reduce poverty, etc., strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem of this region from an important matter to a necessity. The project emphasized systematic and collective planning for entrepreneurial ecosystem components like policies, financial resources, education, research and development, commercial and legal infrastructure, and market dynamics in light of the social and cultural norms.</li>
    <li><em><strong>The importance of Data Science in hospitality and tourism</strong></em>:<br>
        This article examines the impact of data science in enhancing and developing tourism in the Hawraman region, particularly after its global registration as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The focus is on how data science and big data analytics can improve decision-making and policy development to boost tourism, create jobs, and improve social welfare.</li>
    <li><em><strong>The effect of IUI, ICSI, ET Freeze treatment methods on infertile patients</strong></em>: <i>(In progress; Joint work with Dr. Mark Ghamsary from Loma Linda University and Dr. Somayeh Ghiyasi from Ferdawsi Mashhad University)</i>.<br>
        This historical cohort study uses ordinal logistic regression to understand the effects of various infertility treatments and aims to improve the prediction of pregnancy outcomes, thereby aiding in better treatment planning and patient counseling.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Predicting 10-year incidence of dyslipidemia based on novel anthropometric indices</strong></em>: <i>(Submitted; Joint work with Dr. Somayeh Ghiyasi, UNESCO International Center for Basic Sciences Related to Human Health and Nutrition, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran).</i>.<br>
        This research uses exploratory regression models and data mining techniques to predict the incidence of dyslipidemia, focusing on novel anthropometric indices and their relationship with this condition over a 10-year period.</li>
</ul>
