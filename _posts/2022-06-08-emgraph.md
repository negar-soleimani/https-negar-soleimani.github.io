## Abstract
<strong>Background:</strong><br>
Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after one year of sexual intercourse without the use of any method of contraception. Various studies have reported that the most common causes of infertility are male factor, female factor, the existence of two factors together, and infertility with unknown cause.
<strong>Objective:</strong><br>
The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of IUI, ICSI, and ET Freeze treatment methods on infertile patients. The study also aims to model a categorical response, i.e., pregnancy outcome, in terms of some predictors. The goodness of fit will be determined, and an appropriate and more parsimonious model will be selected to offer useful suggestions and recommendations.
<strong>Materials and Methods:</strong><br>
This historical cohort study was conducted in a referral infertility center located in Tehran, Iran. Data from 2011 to 2014 were collected, which included 46 attributes and, 6463 observations. Ordinal logistic regression with categorical response variables (pregnancy, abortion, and blighted) was used to analyze the data.
<strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
The success of IUI in infertile individuals is considerably affected by BMI, duration of infertility and age. The success of ICSI in infertile individuals is considerably affected by BMI, duration of infertility, number of embryos, number of injected oocytes, female cause of infertility, age, PCOS, fertilization rate, day of transfer, number of abortions, number 1of pre ART, and number of grade A embryos. The success of ET Freeze in infertile individuals is considerably affected by age, number of abortions.
