## Abstract
The aim of this study is to investigate the predictive role of biochemical, environmental, and psychological factors in the occurrence of metabolic components in the employees of Gol Gohar Mining and Industrial Company using machine learning methods and growth models. In phase 1, after cleaning the available data in the sections of clinical tests, occupational hazards, symptoms, lung function assessment, audiometry, and visual acuity assessment, the information of employees during the years 1395 to 1399 for all individuals as well as fixed individuals in these years has been descriptively analyzed and statistically examined. Also, correlation between the required sections has been established and based on the obtained information, factors influencing employees' health can be identified. In phase 2, to discover the relationship between various factors, the available information is longitudinally analyzed and examined.
