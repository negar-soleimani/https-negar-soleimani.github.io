  I am a Data Science graduate with a strong passion for research and study, accompanied by a proven track 
  record of excellent performance. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Razi University in Kermanshah, 
  where I established a solid foundation in statistics and probability. During my Master's studies at the reputable 
  Allameh Tabataba'i University in Tehran, I further strengthened my expertise in advanced topics such as Graph Theory, 
  Bayesian Statistics for high-dimensional data, and Machine Learning. I am eager to leverage data for innovative 
  solutions and tackle complex challenges across various domains. My expertise lies in statistical methods, machine 
  learning techniques, graphical models, and Bayesian approaches.
  
  
 
    


  
 # I'm NG holding a BEng. in computer software engineering since 2018. My academic passions encompass the
 # cutting-edge research conducted in the fields of machine learning; particularly, methods that are
 # trying to understand and represent the surrounding world optimally.<br>

 # During my B.Eng., recommendation systems, and bioinformatics were what I was interested in, along which I engrossed in
 # machine learning and deep learning fields. Those were the impetuses to delve more deeply into the theories.
 # Following the outstanding papers and research published by the internationally renowned research-labs and
 # tech-companies for the last few years, on the one hand, I have acquired a general idea of the current challenges scientists
 # are facing. On the other hand, having an avid interest in coding and hands-on stuff, I've got an up-to-date knowledge of
 # current technologies used in the field of machine learning, including a couple of frameworks and libraries as
 # well as some of the well-known optimization and high-performance computing techniques.<br>
 # <br>
#  ### Technical skills<br>
#
#  Will be uploaded soon<br>
#
#  I'm a bit pressed for time at the moment, however, I will upload more information later on. If you think you'll come
#  here once in a blue moon and I can help you out in someway, then you can drop me an email or check out my
#  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/soran-ghaderi/">Linkedin</a>.

#  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

#  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
